# Approov Integrations Examples

[Approov](https://approov.io) is an API security solution used to verify that requests received by your backend services originate from trusted versions of your mobile apps, and here you can find the Echo Chamber servers examples that are the base for the Approov [quickstarts](/docs) for the Elixir Phoenix Channels.

For more information about how Approov works and why you should use it you can read the [Approov Overview](/OVERVIEW.md) at the root of this repo.
