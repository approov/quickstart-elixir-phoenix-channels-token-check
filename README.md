# Approov QuickStart - Elixir Phoenix Channels Token Check

[Approov](https://approov.io) is an API security solution used to verify that requests received by your backend services originate from trusted versions of your mobile apps.

This repo implements the Approov server-side request verification code in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), which performs the verification check before allowing valid traffic to be processed by the API endpoint.

This is an Approov integration quickstart example for the Elixir Phoenix framework, that uses the Channels library to check the Approov token. If you are looking for another Elixir integration you can check our list of [quickstarts](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-integration-examples/backend-api/), and if you don't find what you are looking for, then please let us know [here](https://approov.io/contact).

> **@NOTE**: This is a Work in Progress in the branch `dev_quickstart*`.
